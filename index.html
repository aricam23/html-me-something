<p>Once upon a time, there was a warren of young rabbits. All these rabbits were equally fuzzy &amp; white. Just outside of their rabbit hole was a field, where the wolves would run &amp; play. Over time, the rabbits &amp; wolves began frolicking together. They were the best of friends! </p></article>

 <p>One day, one of the rabbits, who was no different from the rest of the cute fuzzy bunnies, was talking to a pack of wolves, &amp; then decided to go out on a limb &amp; start talking about how tasty he was.</p></article>

<article><p>"MMMMMMMMmm" Two Ears said to the wolves, "Look how yummy I am! I bet my tail would be SOOO delicious! I just wish everyone in the world would know how delicious my tail was!"</p></article>

 <article><p>The wolves couldn't help themselves. Despite the rules of the <s>forums</s> field, the wolves just could not resist anymore, &amp; they decided to take a bite off of Two Ears' tail. Two Ears was sad for a while, but eventually returned to play with the wolves.</p></article>

<article><p>He then engaged in yet another conversation, &amp; started talking about how yummy his hind legs were.</p></article>

<article><p>"MMMMMMMmm" Two Ears proclaimed to the wolves, "I cant even imagine how yummy my hind legs must be! They are just so perfect for the taking, &amp; look at them! Those are some amazing hind legs!"</p></article>

<article><p>Yet again, the wolves could not st&amp; themselves. They chased down little Two Ears, &amp; took turns tearing apart his legs, leaving little Two Ears all stranded.</p></article>

<article><p>Eventually, Two Ears built up the strength to drag himself to the rabbit hole, where he stayed for a while, &amp; worked on his upper body strength. One day, he was strong enough to make it out to play in the field with the other rabbits &amp; the wolves again. He was so happy &amp; excited!</p></article>

<article><p>&amp; then he just lost control &amp; started going on the same way about his ears!
"MMMMMMMMMMMMMmmm!!!!" Two Ears proclaimed "My ears must be so tasty! They are just there &amp; delicious! I wish I could taste my ears right now!"</p></article>

<article><p>The wolves just shrugged &amp; proceeded to eat off Two Ears' ears. Two Ears became depressed. He returned to the rabbit hole, &amp; didn't play with the wolves for a loooong time.</p></article>

<article><p>Where Two Ears went wrong, is even though it made him sad and hurt him every time he did it, he kept putting himself out to the wolves, so that they could find out how yummy he was! Two Ears was no different from every other bunny, he was just as badass, unique, &amp; awesome as the rest of them, yet he felt the need to constantly point out his uniqueness to the wolves, &amp; they simply could not resist once he left himself as open as he did. In the end, Two Ears learned a valuable lesson, at the cost of his tail, his legs, &amp; his ears. Two Ears was still unique &amp; badass, but no longer felt the need to point it out to any of the wolves, because he didn't want to lose what little he had left. Once he stopped pointing himself out to the wolves, they left him alone, &amp; treated him as every other rabbit in the warren.</p></article>

 <p>Hop on, little Two Ears. Hop on.</p>
